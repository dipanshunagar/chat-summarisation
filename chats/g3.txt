20/10/16, 7:09 pm - Dipanshu Nagar: ~meta
20/10/16, 7:13 pm - Kriti Shreshtha: So Monday morning at 10 am in library. Sounds like a plan?
20/10/16, 7:14 pm - Dipanshu Nagar: Sure. That's final, I think.
20/10/16, 7:54 pm - Adetee Sharma: I just started reading Punjabi Parmesan. You guys should definitely give it a try!
20/10/16, 7:55 pm - Utkarsha Kashyap: That's great. What is the genre?
20/10/16, 7:55 pm - Kriti Shreshtha: Adetee, I have not heard about this book before. Can you tell us in more detail?
20/10/16, 7:57 pm - Adetee Sharma: Its an analysis of the immigrant culture in Europe and how the basic jobs have been taken up by them and how it has affected the natives. Its a good read specially if you like knowing about the European market.
20/10/16, 7:57 pm - Utkarsha Kashyap: This seems very interesting.
20/10/16, 7:59 pm - Kriti Shreshtha: Sounds interesting.
20/10/16, 8:01 pm - Kriti Shreshtha: My favorite book is Unaccustomed Earth by Jhumpa Lahiri.
20/10/16, 8:03 pm - Kriti Shreshtha: It is a collection of short stories that explores the lives of Indian Americans.
20/10/16, 8:14 pm - Adetee Sharma: I'll add it to my list of books to be read.
20/10/16, 8:14 pm - Adetee Sharma: I'm a huge fan of Jhumpa Lahiri.
20/10/16, 8:15 pm - Adetee Sharma: I loved her book called The Namesake. You guys must have read it or watched the movie.
20/10/16, 8:18 pm - Utkarsha Kashyap: Is this her first novel?
20/10/16, 8:19 pm - Kriti Shreshtha: No this is not her first book. In fact this was her second collection of short stories.
20/10/16, 8:20 pm - Kriti Shreshtha: First one being, Interpreter of Maladies, a Pulitzer prize winner.
20/10/16, 8:23 pm - Dipanshu Nagar: I have the book Interpreter of Maladies, my sister bought it. I haven't read it though. 😅
20/10/16, 8:25 pm - Kriti Shreshtha: I haven't read Interpreter of Maladies. But i am not sure if you will like Unaccustomed Earth, Dipanshu.
20/10/16, 8:27 pm - Dipanshu Nagar: Why do you think so?
20/10/16, 8:28 pm - Kriti Shreshtha: It is a book that revolves around stories of strained human relationships.
20/10/16, 8:29 pm - Adetee Sharma: So it involves a lot of emotions?
20/10/16, 8:31 pm - Kriti Shreshtha: Yes. It deals with the strained relationship of a father and his daughter, between a son and his step mother.
20/10/16, 8:33 pm - Kriti Shreshtha: So the genre might not be appealing enough to you, Dipanshu.
20/10/16, 8:37 pm - Dipanshu Nagar: Oh. Looks pretty intense. 🙄
I'll just resort to sci-fi and non-fiction for now. 😛
20/10/16, 8:39 pm - Adetee Sharma: I haven't read a lot of sci-fi novels. You should suggest me some Dipanshu.
20/10/16, 8:44 pm - Dipanshu Nagar: Sure, I will give you a list. 😁
20/10/16, 8:44 pm - Dipanshu Nagar: I also have the kindle editions of several books.
20/10/16, 8:44 pm - Kriti Shreshtha: I am pretty sure he will suggest The Hitchhiker's Guide to Galaxy. 😝
20/10/16, 8:45 pm - Dipanshu Nagar: Right, that has got be on the list. 😝
20/10/16, 8:45 pm - Dipanshu Nagar: I suggest it to everyone.😁
20/10/16, 8:46 pm - Dipanshu Nagar: But still people don't read. 😒
20/10/16, 8:54 pm - Adetee Sharma: Yes, he told me about this before. Actually, I don't have any book after Punjabi Parmesan for reading.
20/10/16, 9:04 pm - Kriti Shreshtha: I can lend you books, Adetee. Have you read Diary of a Young Girl?
20/10/16, 9:04 pm - Kriti Shreshtha: It is one of my all time favourites.
20/10/16, 9:14 pm - Dipanshu Nagar: Tanvi likes Diary of a Young Girl, also I think. 😁
Someone told me, if not her. 😅
20/10/16, 9:21 pm - Kriti Shreshtha: That's good. For light reading i like Ruskin Bond's stories. I have two books of his - The Room on The Roof and The Ruskin Bond Children's Omnibus.
20/10/16, 9:30 pm - Adetee Sharma: Even I've got his set of short stories. He is one of my favourite child authors.
20/10/16, 9:33 pm - Kriti Shreshtha: My personal favorite is Grandfather's Private Zoo.
20/10/16, 9:35 pm - Kriti Shreshtha: It has been a dream of mine to have pets like Ruskin Bond's grandfather, ranging from a Hornbill to a monkey to even a snake!
20/10/16, 10:50 pm - Adetee Sharma: Exactly! There was one author shonwrote about her pets in hindi. I guess her name was Mahadevi Verma.
20/10/16, 11:06 pm - Adetee Sharma: ~meta Exactly! There was one author who wrote about her pets in hindi. I guess her name was Mahadevi Verma.
20/10/16, 11:06 pm - Adetee Sharma: The only story I used to enjoy in the Hindi literature book 😜
20/10/16, 11:07 pm - Kriti Shreshtha: Yes. I remember her stories used to be a part of my Hindi course books.
20/10/16, 11:08 pm - Adetee Sharma: One of the other books that formed a major part of my growing up was the Chicken Soup series.
20/10/16, 11:08 pm - Adetee Sharma: They have such beautiful short stories.
20/10/16, 11:10 pm - Kriti Shreshtha: I'll add Chicken Soup series to my list of books to be read.
20/10/16, 11:10 pm - Tanvi Virmani: Adetee, I've also read Chicken Soup series. The stories were really beautiful.
20/10/16, 11:20 pm - Tanvi Virmani: Also, I read 'When Breath becomes Air' by Paul Kalinithi. It's sort of an autobiography on how he came to get inflicted with lung cancer, and how he lived up until he died because of it. It's such an emotional account and so intense that it has the capacity to bring you to tears by the end.
20/10/16, 11:23 pm - Kriti Shreshtha: Yes, Dipanshu told me about this book.
20/10/16, 11:25 pm - Kriti Shreshtha: It is so horrifying to imagine what a dying person feels like. I am pretty sure i won't make it to the end of the book without crying.
20/10/16, 11:28 pm - Tanvi Virmani: Yeah I can imagine 😋
20/10/16, 11:33 pm - Kriti Shreshtha: 🙈 And since we are talking about favorite books, i have to mention Harry Potter series. 😋😋 I am a die hard fan of all the seven books and the spin offs in the series.
20/10/16, 11:57 pm - Adetee Sharma: That looks like a must read. Such books teach us the importance of gratitude in life and how blessed we are.
20/10/16, 11:58 pm - Adetee Sharma: Kriti I am borrowing the entire set from you in December 🙈
21/10/16, 12:00 am - Kriti Shreshtha: 😄😄 Sure!
