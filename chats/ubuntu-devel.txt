[12:12] <jmg> its not relevant
[12:12] <jmg> to my issue
[12:12] <LaserJock> ah
[12:13] <LaserJock> well, if you've searched and can't find a similar bug you can always file one if you think there is indeed a bug
[12:18] <LaserJock> cjwatson: does/can a sync from Debian overwrite and existing .orig.tar.gz?
[12:18] <LaserJock> *an
[12:19] <cjwatson> not one with the same name, no
[12:19] <LaserJock> we've got a situation where Ubuntu had an .orig.tar.gz before Debian
[12:19] <cjwatson> the only thing you can do in that circumstance is a "fake sync" using the Ubuntu .orig.tar.gz but producing a result equivalent to the Debian package
[12:20] <LaserJock> same version, files are the same, just different creation times on the tarball so the md5sums don't match
[12:20] <cjwatson> normally using the Debian diff, but check that the Debian and Ubuntu .orig.tar.gzs produce basically the same content
[12:20] <cjwatson> right, so Ubuntu .orig.tar.gz, Debian .diff.gz, new debian/changelog entry with "build1" on the end, upload
[12:20] <LaserJock> that's what I was thinking, excellent
[12:21] <LaserJock> thanks
[12:21] <bhale> would the next sync work after that?
[12:21] <bhale> or you are stuck until new upstream
[12:21] <LaserJock> stuck until new upstream I guess
[12:21] <bhale> thought so
[12:21] <LaserJock> this has happened more then once I think
[12:22] <LaserJock> it would be nice if we could just replace the Ubuntu .orig.tar.gz with the Debian one
[12:22] <shawarma> LaserJock: The problem is the old .dsc files that still contain the old md5.
[12:22] <shawarma> LaserJock: and they're all stored in the same placed and signed and everything.
[12:23] <cjwatson> bhale: as LaserJock said
[12:23] <cjwatson> LaserJock: breaks mirrors, no can do
[12:24] <bhale> LaserJock: well
[12:24] <cjwatson> shawarma: also that mirrors would have to use rsync --checksum rather than just relying on filenames, which is a big fat extra load
[12:24] <bhale> LaserJock: it is often known what cases it will happen in
[12:24] <bhale> LaserJock: a heads up to the Debian maintainer usually makes it a non-issue in my experience
[12:24] <shawarma> cjwatson: Oh, i thought they did that already.
[12:24] <shawarma> cjwatson: But of course, that'd be silly since we never change any existing files.
[12:25] <shawarma> cjwatson: ..apart from Packages.gz and such.
[12:26] <shawarma> cjwatson: Are Release, Sources, and Packages rsynced on the side then?
[12:26] <cjwatson> filenames are unique in the archive; this is an invariant
[12:26] <cjwatson> sure
[12:26] <cjwatson> they're often done in a separate
[12:26] <cjwatson> er
[12:26] <cjwatson> dists/ is different
[12:26] <cjwatson> in fact I think it's just pool/ that has the uniqueness constraint - it's the biggest bit by far
[12:26] <alex-weej> whoever recommended dd_rhelp to me the other day
[12:26] <alex-weej> you are a LEGEND
[12:27] <alex-weej> it is closing up dead holes on my disk image really well
[12:27] <cjwatson> shawarma: I believe so
[12:27] <cjwatson> see e.g. http://www.debian.org/mirror/anonftpsync
[12:28] <LaserJock> cjwatson: if we upload as build1 will it cause problems for the Feisty+1 syncing (i.e. normally build1 packages are automatically synced)?
[12:29] <shawarma> cjwatson: I see. That would explain why Packages sometimes referes to files that are no more.
[12:30] <cjwatson> LaserJock: no; at worst those syncs will harmlessly fail and will have to be merged
[12:30] <cjwatson> (this isn't a new problem - we have a fair bit of experience with this :-))
[12:30] <LaserJock> heh
[12:30] <LaserJock> ok, thanks
[12:30] <cjwatson> np
[12:30] <shawarma> cjwatson: So the complete version would be what? Debian is 1.27-2, so we'd make 1.27-2ubuntu0build1 ?
[12:30] <cjwatson> shawarma: right
[12:30] <cjwatson> no, 1.27-2build1
[12:31] <cjwatson> the effect of "ubuntu" in a version is precisely to suppress automatic syncing
[12:31] <shawarma> cjwatson: ...which we want?
[12:31] <cjwatson> in this case you don't want to do that - either there's no new upstream and the sync will fail harmlessly, or there's a new upstream and you want to autosync
[12:31] <shawarma> cjwatson: ..since manual intervention is needed anyhow.
[12:31] <cjwatson> only if there's no new upstream
[12:32] <cjwatson> we don't want to overload people doing merges, so if the worst thing that happens is that a sync fails, big deal, we ignore that
[12:32] <shawarma> cjwatson: Ah... Yes, now I get it.
[12:32] <cjwatson> it's better to try to autosync where possible
[12:32] <shawarma> cjwatson: Indeed. Makes sense. Thanks.

[12:53] <holycow> anyone here good at packaging?  i was curious if i could get someone to compile and package these drivers: http://doc.gwos.org/index.php/Nvidia_nForce_SoundStorm
[12:53] <holycow> i'd just like to have the .deb around for the future, i won't be buying this damned chipset anymore
[12:55] <infinity> holycow: Try #ubuntu-motu
[12:55] <holycow> danke
[12:55] <infinity> (If you want it packaged in multiverse)
[12:55] <infinity> It's certainly never going to be in restricted, since nvidia doesn't support the driver anymore.
[12:55] <holycow> not a bad idea, never thought of it
[12:55] <holycow> nforce is no longer supported?
[12:56] <infinity> No, the driver isn't supported.  nvidia tells people to use the open source drivers instead.
[12:56] <holycow> for nforce?
[12:56] <infinity> (One would assume they're contributing to the open source drivers sucking less, slowly)
[12:56] <infinity> For nforce sound, yes.
[12:56] <holycow> odd
[12:56] <holycow> well they do provide source files for the chipset, the chipset controls a bunch of things
[12:57] <Solarion> is the gpg bug set to be pushed out soon?
[12:57] <holycow> nforce sound eh?  would you know anything about nforce network card or vid support?
[12:58] <holycow> i presuve nv drivers supports video
[12:58] <holycow> maybe then just getting a newer kernel might workie
[12:58] <mjg59> They're all supported with open drivers
[12:59] <holycow> okay, in that case, it must be just that dapper doesn't have the latest builds of those, cool thats awesome to know
[12:59] <holycow> i didn't manage to google that up

[12:59] <holycow> did nvidia open source the drivers or did they just give up when someone reverse engineered them?
[01:00] <bhale> the later, roughly
[01:00] <holycow> heh
[01:00] <Burgwork> holycow: more a matter of poking the hardware and seeing how it jumps
[01:01] <holycow> aha okay.

[01:02] <keescook> geser: great, do you have a URL for them?
[01:03] <geser> what exactly should I upload? is the diff.gz enough?
[01:03] <holycow> would it be fair to say that the best supported chipset these days are intel chipsets?
[01:03] <mjg59> Yes
[01:03] <holycow> then its time to switch i think

[02:29] <alex-weej> does anyone know if i can safely mount a disk image (read-only) that is actively being written to?
[02:30] <jdong> alex-weej: no
[02:31] <alex-weej> is that a "i know, and the answer is no"
[02:31] <alex-weej> or a "no i don't know"?
=== fnordus [n=dnall@24.85.128.203]  has joined #ubuntu-devel
[02:31] <jdong> (1) read-only is not always taken so literally. ext3 actually does a JOURNAL PLAYBACK when you mount it ro :)
[02:31] <alex-weej> o_0
[02:31] <bluefoxicy> o.O
[02:31] <jdong> (2) If significant structures change while you're reading, you'll get a kernel panic or oops
[02:31] <jdong> I have experienced both
[02:31] <alex-weej> heh
[02:31] <alex-weej> ok
[02:31] <jdong> I am the authority on doing crackful things
[02:31] <jdong> :)
[02:32] <bluefoxicy> jdong:  most drivers will rework it and remount ro or just umount
[02:32] <bluefoxicy> for file system being ass
[02:32] <jdong> bluefoxicy: in theory :)
[02:32] <alex-weej> dd_rhelp is really struggling on the last few MB of this disk
[02:32] <bluefoxicy> yes
[02:32] <bluefoxicy> that theory is "Faulty hardware means we try to back off safely"
[02:32] <jdong> bluefoxicy: I've panicked ext3 with -o errors=remount-ro before
[02:32] <bluefoxicy> I'm aware the reality can be "Let's do a BSOD"
[02:32] <jdong> bluefoxicy: that's from xen and my system both mounting a disk
[02:33] <bluefoxicy> XD
[02:33] <jdong> so alex-weej, either momentarily stop dd-rhelp or wait on mounting :)
[02:33] <jdong> and make sure you mount a COPY
[02:33] <jdong> not the original backup image
[02:33] <jdong> because as I've said, a simple ro mount can change the image
[02:33] <alex-weej> yeah i'm gonna
[02:33] <alex-weej> copying a 108 GB image is going to take a while
[02:34] <jdong> :)
[02:34] <jdong> the sweet sound of hard disk failure
=== jdong knows that sound too well
=== alex-weej too now
[02:34] <jdong> from that first click-click-click to the spindown :)
[02:34] <jdong> lol
[02:34] <alex-weej> it's done pretty well tbh
[02:34] <alex-weej> - Biggest hole size :  800 k - total holes : 4656.0k
[02:34] <alex-weej> - xferd(succ/err) : 116161327.5k(116161195.5k/132.0k)
[02:34] <wasabi> Sure wish OCFS2's module was in the -generic kernel. =/
[02:35] <wasabi> so i could play with it
[02:35] <jdong> alex-weej: that's very good
[02:35] <jdong> alex-weej: a helluva lot better than I've ever done
[02:35] <alex-weej> taken me 6 hours
[02:35] <jdong> alex-weej: you caught that failure early
[02:35] <jdong> or you're just lucky
[02:36] <alex-weej> oop it's off again
[02:36] <alex-weej> - Biggest hole size :  736 k - total holes : 4212.0k
[02:36] <alex-weej> - xferd(succ/err) : 116161771.5k(116161635.5k/136.0k)
[02:36] <alex-weej> :D
[02:36] <alex-weej> still lost 4k though :(
[02:36] <alex-weej> do you know if that "err" bit is totally dead disk?
[02:37] <alex-weej> i might leave it going overnight see how well it is when i wake up
[02:37] <jdong> alex-weej: the err is how many blocks dd_rescue (not dd_rhelp!) stumbled on
[02:37] <jdong> alex-weej: when dd_rescue stumbles, dd_rhelp helps dd_rescue fast-forward a bit
[02:37] <jdong> alex-weej: so in reality succ/err is pretty nonsensical
[02:37] <jdong> alex-weej: it's the hole sizes that you need to worry about :)
[02:37] <jdong> alex-weej: I hope that's ext2/3, btw
[02:38] <alex-weej> yeah, why?
[02:38] <jdong> alex-weej: for the recovery ;-)
[02:38] <alex-weej> you think i should make a copy then fsck it?
[02:38] <jdong> alex-weej: a lot of the other filesystems have a good deal of "magic metadata" that if lost means a good chunk of the structure disappears (!)
[02:38] <jdong> alex-weej: you should absolutely make a copy of it
[02:38] <jdong> fscking it is a good start
[02:38] <alex-weej> uh oh
[02:39] <alex-weej> don't like the sound of it being a "good start"
[02:39] <alex-weej> i've put like a whole evening into this already lol
[02:39] <jdong> well
[02:39] <jdong> fsck isn't always failproof
[02:39] <jdong> it can either
[02:39] <jdong> (1) Die / core-dump in the middle of repairing
[02:39] <jdong> (2) Give up and start slashing inode entries until you're left with 2 files
[02:39] <jdong> and then call it "clean" :D
[02:40] <alex-weej> :|
[02:40] <jdong> just hope that neither happens :)
[02:40] <alex-weej> btw
[02:40] <alex-weej> if i just mount a copy
[02:40] <alex-weej> without fsking

[02:40] <jdong> sure, you can try that
[02:40] <alex-weej> if i try and copy files off will i get potentially corrupt files or is there some sort of checksumming in effect?
[02:40] <jdong> though there's a possibility a good chunk of directories are not available
[02:41] <jdong> i.e. you get an IO Error or Operation Not Permitted trying to enter a directory
[02:41] <alex-weej> hmm
[02:41] <alex-weej> i'm curious
[02:41] <jdong> depends on whether or not any of that 4000K is filesystem metadata
[02:41] <jdong> which I'm betting at least a bit of it is :-/
[02:41] <jdong> you can try it
[02:41] <jdong> hence the point of the "copy" :)
[02:41] <alex-weej> reckon i can hot copy the image that is being written to?
[02:42] <alex-weej> it's not easy to pause this thing
[02:42] <alex-weej> it's blocking like a bitch
[02:42] <alex-weej> and it's uninterruptable

[06:49] <keescook> twb: I've been thinking about adding something like that.  However, I worry about serious issues getting ignored due to those classifications, though.  for example, the tar USN would have "local", but there are plenty of websites that automatically process tar files, so really it's remote vuln for them...
=== haggai [n=halls@credativ.bcnadsl.com]  has joined #ubuntu-devel
[06:53] <twb> keescook: I suppose...
[06:54] <keescook> twb: but, I agree: it'd be nice to have a little something more.  :)
[06:55] <Burgundavia> keescook: see what secunia puts out. Is quite good
[06:55] <Burgundavia> they also rate the vuln, which is fairly useful, if a little arbitrary
[06:55] <infinity> Any rating between "minor" and "critical" is pretty useless, IMO.
[06:55] <keescook> yeah, I like secunia's stuff.  :)
[06:56] <keescook> hey infinity!  :)
[06:56] <infinity> "This is something only a pedant will care about" versus "Jumping Judas, update your system yesterday."
[06:56] <keescook> heh
[06:56] <infinity> Any in between is so arbitrary that it's worthless, which makes the whole system of ratings somewhat worthless.
[06:57] <infinity> "Well, this could be sort of bad, on a Tuesday, if you're downloading porn."
[06:57] <Burgundavia> however, there are vulns which are worse than others
[06:58] <infinity> There are.  remote/local, root/not, should be enough for most people to decide on their own.
[06:58] <infinity> Too many factors on the local machine to say beyond that what's "bad" and what's not.
[06:58] <infinity> I may be some SELinux freak who doesn't even care about privilege escalation, or I may be a bank behind 4000 firewalls who doesn't care about remote vulns, etc.
[06:59] <infinity> Or, other considerations, like things that rely on poor user habits would be "no big deal" to me, but a huge deal to a corporation full of "regular users".
[06:59] <Burgundavia> yep
[06:59] <infinity> And on it goes.
[07:02] <infinity> Now, we *could* rate vulns based on the potential for humour.
[07:02] <infinity> "If your friends are caught by this one, you can TOTALLY point and laugh."
[07:03] <Burgundavia> humour value: 4.3 (likely to be activating while browsing goat porn)

[08:38] <pitti> only -minimal
[08:38] <infinity> Which is also pretty sketchy.
[08:38] <infinity> But here, it's Essential.
[08:39] <pitti> but wasn't -minimal specifically introduced to become an essential package?
[08:39] <infinity> No
[08:39] <pitti> ('yay for writing postinst scripts in python' or so?)
[08:39] <infinity> minimal has all sorts of stuff in it that doesn't qualify as "Essential", as far as Debian policy would define it.
[08:40] <infinity> Oh, we're talking about two different "minimals" :)
[08:40] <twb> Well, Ubuntu doesn't stick to the Debian policy.

[08:41] <infinity> twb: That's not Policy, that's DFSG.
[08:41] <twb> Well, I assumed policy said something like `only DFSG in main'.
[08:41] <infinity> Debian Policy is about packaging, not politics.
[08:42] <infinity> And we adhere to it as best we can, or the world explodes.
[08:42] <doko> infinity: hmm, yes, looking at it; the essential attribute was dropped in my last update
[08:42] <infinity> pitti: python-minimal is Priority: Required, python somehow ended up Essential: yes recently.
[08:42] <pitti> infinity: ok, my package index is from yesterday still

[08:43] <twb> Section 2.2.1, "Every package in _main_ must comply with the DFSG (Debian Free Software Guidelines)."
[08:43] <doko> infinity: 2.4.4-1ubuntu1
[08:43] <twb> Ubuntu concretely does not follow that part of the policy w.r.t. tar-doc, which has invariant sections.
[08:43] <infinity> twb: Okay, fine, we don't adhere to 2.2.1 (or, you could argue that we read the DFSG differently from Debian)
[08:44] <infinity> twb: Point taken, though.  We don't adhere to Policy 100%.  That doesn't mean we ignore it.
[08:44] <twb> I'm not implying that Ubuntu not sticking to Debian policy is a *bad* thing; merely that it is *a* thing.

[09:17] <twb> On its own branch, eh?
[09:18] <Mithrandir> yeah, so since you're interested in the NFS support and such, just merge the bits relevant to that.
[09:18] <Mithrandir> (on one branche9

[09:18] <twb> I should also mention that I'm used to darcs, not bzr.
=== ivoks_ [n=ivoks@36-204.dsl.iskon.hr]  has joined #ubuntu-devel
[09:20] <twb> BTW, I notice the edgy .orig.tar.gz has a .bzr in it.  IIRC that's against policy.
[09:20] <cjwatson> that's a longstanding debate :)
[09:21] <twb> OK.
[09:21] <cjwatson> I don't believe policy specifies; feel free to cite chapter and verse if I missed it
[09:21] <cjwatson> and I avoid it in my own packages, but Mithrandir likes it that way ...
[09:21] <Mithrandir> twb: .bzr directories are useful to random people, unlike .svn or CVS directories.
[09:23] <hunger> Would it be possible to stop the new sun-java5-plugin deb to require an /usr/lib/iceweasel/plugins dir to create symlinks in? That does not exist in ubuntu (yet?).
[09:23] <cjwatson> hunger: there's no harm in packages providing hooks for extra browsers
[09:24] <cjwatson> my mozilla-nukeimage package provides hooks for a big pile of browsers that won't be installed. I think that's fine - harmless and easier than divergence
[09:24] <hunger> cjwatson: Sure, but then it should check for the existance of that dir before failing in the postinst script.
[09:24] <cjwatson> hunger: oh, it should just ship it in the .deb
[09:24] <cjwatson> the directory
[09:24] <cjwatson> that's a bug
[09:24] <hunger> cjwatson: Yes, that is an option, too:-)
[09:24] <cjwatson> that's the correct option
[09:25] <cjwatson> otherwise it breaks on Debian if installed before iceweasel

[10:01] <seb128> and e-d-s was available before new evo
[10:01] <seb128> ok
[10:01] <seb128> so I did the updates on my box
[10:01] <seb128> packaged e-d-s first
[10:01] <iwj> If you dpkg -i it then it deconfigures the broken package and apt is too lame to cope.
[10:01] <seb128> dpkg -i *.deb for it
[10:01] <seb128> and from that point apt was stucked
[10:01] <seb128> I had to dpkg -r evolution
[10:01] <iwj> But there's nothing fundamentally wrong.
[10:02] <iwj> Right, that's a fine workaround.
[10:02] <seb128> I somewhat think that apt should manage and keep working
[10:02] <iwj> Or --configure --force-depends if you prefer.
[10:03] <iwj> seb128: Yes, it should.  But it's fundamental to apt's design that it can't ignore some problem even if you don't want it fixed and it can't fix it.
[10:03] <Keybuk> pitti: I would have thought the IP it announced would depend on the interface that the MDNS packet was received on?
[10:03] <mvo> iwj: right. part of apts design is that the system shouldn't be broken
[10:03] <pitti> Keybuk: that's what I would expect as well, and so far it worked fine with my experiments
[10:03] <mvo> I don't think there is anything wrong with this
[10:04] <pitti> Keybuk: seems that the vmnet ones confuse avahi; I'll talk to lennart about this
[10:04] <seb128> iwj: ok, I was expecting it doing the same as for Conflicts, i.e: remove evolution on "apt-get -f install" to "fix" the situation
[10:04] <iwj> But that doesn't fix it of course.
[10:04] <Keybuk> pitti: with those up, I can't even look up the address from another machine
[10:04] <Keybuk> (I assume the replies get lost?)
[10:04] <seb128> well, that allows apt to work again
[10:05] <seb128> instead of focussing on the Breaks it can't resolve
[10:05] <pitti> Keybuk: sounds like it
[10:05] <Keybuk> actually, I can't seem to look it up anyway
[10:05] <pitti> Keybuk: the other machine runs avahi as well?
[10:05] <Keybuk> yes
[10:05] <pitti> Keybuk: avahi-discovery is quite handy for that, btw
[10:05] <seb128> iwj: anyway, no big deal, that happened only because I dpkg -i the package using Break on my box, will not happen to users
[10:05] <Keybuk> pitti: example?
[10:05] <pitti> if you see the other machine appear, DNS should work
[10:05] <iwj> seb128: Right.
[10:05] <pitti> Keybuk: example? it's  just a gui that displays what avahi knows
[10:06] <pitti> Keybuk: btw, if you try this on powerpc, avahi seems to be seriously broken on ppc ATM
[10:06] <Keybuk> avahi-discover on the desktop (edgy) shows itself and my laptop (feisty)
[10:06] <pitti> s/seems to be/is/
[10:06] <Keybuk> avahi-discover on the laptop (feisty) only shows itself
[10:07] <Keybuk> both of them say "Timeout reached" if I click the laptop
[10:07] <iwj> mvo: No, apt demands that the package state database doesn't record that the system is broken.  (Eg, it is happy that the system fails to have evolution installed when the user wanted it, but not happy if the database records that evolution is there but not working.)
[10:07] <pitti> Keybuk: (later, after discussion in meeting)
[10:07] <iwj> And in fact apt is willing to break the system further in order to make the status database prettier.
[10:07] <iwj> But perhaps this is more of a rant for a bar somewhere :-).
[10:08] <mvo> iwj: I see your point, but from a user perspective it dosn't matter IMHO if its not working because it is not there or not working because it is there but not working :)
[10:09] <iwj> mvo: Well, yes, except that if it's there and not working at least it gets put back and made to work later.

[11:35] <ogra> tepsipakki, you can do merges as "non-core-dev" but should contact the person listed on the merges page for uploading
[11:35] <pitti> Keybuk: could you please put your interfaces configuration and 'avahi-browse -at' into a bug report about avahi, so that I can point Lennart to this?
[11:35] <tepsipakki> ogra: yes, sure
[11:35] <tepsipakki> thanks
[11:37] <Keybuk> pitti: for which, vmware or the "I get no DNS" ?
[11:37] <pitti> Keybuk: oh, you don't get any DNS at all, or just not for .local?
[11:37] <pitti> Keybuk: I mainly meant the vmware issue, although they sound related
[11:37] <Keybuk> pitti: I don't get any service discovery at all
[11:37] <Keybuk> even with vmware turned off
[11:37] <Keybuk> so I have two problems
[11:38] <Keybuk> 1) when vmware is running, the wrong IP is answered
[11:38] <cjwatson> tepsipakki: to be honest it's usually not worth it for non-core-devs to do main merges - it tends to be more work to review somebody else's merge than to just do it, IME
[11:38] <pitti> Keybuk: is that powerpc?
[11:38] <cjwatson> tepsipakki: except perhaps in very complicated cases
[11:38] <Keybuk> 2) when vmware IS NOT running, I just don't get any service discovery
[11:38] <StevenK> pitti: Not with vmware....
[11:38] <Keybuk> pitti: amd64 on one machine, i386 on the other
[11:38] <Keybuk> pitti: running avahi-discover on my laptop (feisty i386) does not see any services my desktop (edgy amd64) exports, not even its hostname
[11:39] <pitti> Keybuk: on powerpc I have to restart /etc/init.d/avahi-daemon to make it pick up new stuff, maybe that's not just confined to ppc then
[11:39] <Keybuk> the simplest test is "ping quest.local" on my laptop, which returns NXDOMAIN, despite tcpdump showing mdns traffic and replies
[11:39] <pitti> Keybuk: but on your edgy desktop you have avahi-autoipd running?
[11:39] <cjwatson> gar, why is there no gtk.Window.get_default()?
=== Adri2000 [n=Adri2000@unaffiliated/adri2000]  has joined #ubuntu-devel
[11:39] <Keybuk> pitti: restarting avahi-daemon on the feisty machine fixed the problem
[11:40] <Keybuk> pitti: no, edgy desktop just has avahi-daemon running
[11:40] <pitti> Keybuk: it seems to work without restarting on my amd64 box, but I get the effect on my ibook
[11:40] <Keybuk> it's the feisty package that seems broken
[11:40] <pitti> Keybuk: I'll talk to him about that
[11:40] <pitti> right
[11:40] <pitti> Keybuk: AFAICS you need avahi-autoipd to actually announce the IP to avahid
[11:41] <Keybuk> pitti: that's bogus
[11:41] <Keybuk> autoipd is only if you want a link-local IP
[11:41] <pitti> Keybuk: but that might just have been a false impression due to the broken feisty avahi
[11:41] <Keybuk> service discovery and IP discovery is supposed to work on ordinary networks too
[11:41] <pitti> actually yes
[11:41] <Keybuk> the problem just appears to be that the feisty daemon doesn't detect or announce things until it's restarted
[11:42] <pitti> Keybuk: ok, if restarting it fixes things for you then we have the same bug
[11:42] <tepsipakki> cjwatson: yeah, I was looking at syslinux, but maybe start with something easier instead ;)
[11:42] <cjwatson> tepsipakki: doko's on that

[11:43] <Riddell> mvo: any plans to fix the apt i386 fail to build?
[11:43] <cjwatson> tepsipakki: even discounting the above, you should ALWAYS check with the person named on merges.ubuntu.com before starting on a merge
[11:43] <mvo> Riddell: when you build it locally?
[11:43] <cjwatson> otherwise there's a good chance of duplicating work

[11:48] <Mithrandir> ok, good, it just creates new queues with the wrong permissions, they're not reset when my publish-queue script runs.
[11:49] <Keybuk> pitti: the vmware thing does appear to be interesting
[11:49] <Keybuk> basically it does answer differently depending on the interface the request comes in on
[11:49] <Keybuk> if you request from another machine, you get the logical IP for that request
[11:50] <Keybuk> if you request from localhost, you get a random interface <g>

[12:06] <gnomefreak> couldnt you just have e-d-s be held back by apt instead of erroring?

[12:13] <gnomefreak> iwj: it didnt work here as you saw
[12:13] <pitti> Riddell: ugh, seems my latest dapper-updates hal with the fix for scsi cd-roms broke KDE's media mounting (bug 72869)

[12:13] <iwj> Err, you tried _dist-upgrade_.  What does   apt-get upgrade   do for you ?
[12:14] <Riddell> pitti: only for kde 3.5.5, which isn't officially supported
[12:14] <gnomefreak> i already worked around it aptitude puts it in held back
[12:14] <iwj> gnomefreak: Although I suppose it's too late for you to experiment now.
[12:14] <Riddell> pitti: but I'll look into making a suitable hal package for those kubuntu.org packages when I have some spare time
[12:14] <pitti> Riddell: still weird, the change should only cause more CD-ROMs to appear in hal
[12:14] <Riddell> hmm
[12:14] <pitti> Riddell: shall I revert the ubuntu-updates patch for now?
[12:14] <iwj> gnomefreak: Right.  I have a system here which I haven't upgraded yet and   apt-get upgrade   seems to want to do the right thing (I didn't confirm it) whereas dist-upgrade gives the same error as in the bug report.
[12:15] <pitti> it'll break SCSI and USB CD-ROMs again, but...
[12:15] <iwj> gnomefreak: What does   apt-get dist-upgrade   do on your system now ?  I think it will complain still.
[12:15] <Riddell> pitti: I wouldn't revert a fix in ubuntu because it breaks some unsupported packages
[12:15] <iwj> That is, produce that error.   And apt-get upgrade will just say nothing to be done because everything's held back, I think.
[12:15] <gnomefreak> when dpkg is done ill run it
[12:15] <cjwatson> iwj: probably just needs to MarkKeep it?
[12:16] <iwj> cjwatson: It already does that.
[12:16] <cjwatson> where?
[12:16] <iwj> That's how it gets to be held back with `upgrade'.  TBH I need to read the code for dist-upgrade again to know why it hates this.
[12:16] <gnomefreak> dist-upgrade shouldnt error on it at all
[12:16] <cjwatson> iwj: I'm looking at pkgProblemResolver::Resolve and don't see it
[12:16] <iwj> gnomefreak: Yes, I agree.
[12:17] <cjwatson> gnomefreak: you are stating the obvious
[12:17] <pitti> Riddell: still curious; do you happen to have an idea where it breaks?
[12:17] <pitti> Riddell: it shouldn't affect the properties of USB sticks etc. at all
[12:17] <iwj> cjwatson: My suspicion is that `dist-upgrade' thinks that any held back packages mean it has failed and then it refuses to continue.
[12:17] <cjwatson> iwj: not in my experience

[12:18] <gnomefreak> upgrade now has it in held back but so did aptitude

[12:18] <pitti> Riddell: aah, presumably because dapper's KDE didn't yet use the hal backend methods, but pmount? and upstream KDE 3.5.5 does?
[12:18] <gnomefreak> dist-upgrade still wont hold them back 
[12:19] <iwj> gnomefreak: Right, that's as I expect.  That means that `apt-get upgrade' is a workaround.

=== Gman [i=gman@nat/sun/x-490881a309b64110]  has joined #ubuntu-devel
[12:24] <pitti> Riddell: hm, in dapper's hal there's only a '<policy at_console="true">' policy for the Mount methods, no 'group=plugdev' as in edgy
[12:25] <pitti> Riddell: so it actually appears that it should fail the same way with dapper final's hal
[12:26] <pitti> Riddell: the curious thing is that they claimed that downgrading to 18.1 from dapper-proposed fixed it
[12:26] <pitti> Riddell: but 18.2 is the same as 18.1, just uploaded to dapper-updates
[12:26] <Riddell> pitti: the kubuntu.org kde 3.5.5 archive has a modified version of 0.5.7-1ubuntu18.1
[12:27] <pitti> Riddell: aah, that explains it then
[12:27] <pitti> Riddell: so reverting the hal fix in ubuntu would not fix it at all then
[12:27] <Riddell> so I need to (find someone else to) compile hal with the same change for the new version in dapper-updates

[12:38] <xerxas> that's not going to be fixed anytime soon ! 
[12:38] <xerxas> should be trivial 
[12:39] <xerxas> let's try to fix it :)
[12:39] <xerxas> in my dreams

[02:14] <Lathiat> how do you get the network manager tray icon these days?
[02:14] <pitti> Lathiat: Alt+F2 nm-applet
[02:15] <Lathiat> err
[02:15] <Lathiat> netlink.c: dropped message nlmsg_pid=1536174148
=== Lathiat puzzles
[02:15] <pitti> ugh
=== Lathiat checks the data type of that
[02:16] <Lathiat> __u32
[02:16] <pitti> a 16 bit int put into an uninit'ed 32 bit int?
[02:16] <Lathiat> yeh i put %d
=== chris77^ [n=ctam@217.31.69.98]  has left #ubuntu-devel [] 
[02:17] <Lathiat> excuse my apparent incomptence what printf argument do i want to print a __u32 ?
[02:18] <pitti> Lathiat: I thought %d should DTRT for 32 bit, and indeed it prints out a 32 bit number
[02:19] <Lathiat> yeh
[02:19] <Lathiat> weird
[02:19] <pitti> Lathiat: maybe it is written with some pointer conversion magic and only the lower 16 bits get filled?
=== Lathiat figures out the contents of that message
[02:20] <pitti> Lathiat: 1536174148 & 65535 == 64100
[02:20] <cjwatson> I'd probably use printf("%lu", (unsigned long) u32_variable) myself ...
[02:20] <pitti> Lathiat: do you happen to have a process with that number? (although unlikely)
[02:20] <Lathiat> nope
[02:21] <pitti> Lathiat: for the record, same behavior with 2.6.17, so it's not the new kernel
[02:21] <Lathiat> interesting network manager makes avahi see
[02:22] <Lathiat> new interface / withdrawn / net interfaces / withdrawn / new interface
[02:22] <Lathiat> when enabled (from an alreayd disabled state)
[02:22] <Lathiat> hrm
[02:22] <Lathiat> netlink.c: would drop message nlmsg_pid=1536174148 
[02:22] <Lathiat> New relevant interface eth0.IPv4 for mDNS.
=== jsgotangco [i=keefejoh@ubuntu/member/jsgotangco]  has joined #ubuntu-devel
[02:24] <Lathiat> i cant reproduce that
[02:25] <Lathiat> ah, yes i can
[02:25] <Lathiat> this is weird
[02:25] <Lathiat> pitti: do you know much about how network manager works?
[02:26] <pitti> Lathiat: not really at the internals
[02:26] <Lathiat> i see the interface come relevant from root, then disappear, then ti comes back but it fails to join the multicast group
[02:26] <Lathiat> then its withdrawn from a non root pid
[02:26] <Lathiat> then comes back from a non root pid
[02:26] <Lathiat> which if im not dropping them, works
[02:26] <pitti> Lathiat: I uploaded a new n-m yesterday that disables the internal ipv4ll stack and checks for avahi-autoipd (which is called automatically in latest feisty)
[02:27] <Lathiat> is there another tool that will monitor ip changes off netlink?
[02:27] <pitti> Keybuk: ^ do you happen to know?
[02:27] <Lathiat> hrm, yes, iproute2 has a monitor mode
=== Lathiat compares
[02:29] <Lathiat> yeh network manager definitely adds and removes the ips twice then adds it again
[02:29] <Lathiat> dhclient byitself does it once
[02:29] <Lathiat> does network-manager use dhclient?
[02:30] <giskard> yes
[02:30] <pitti> Lathiat: it calls dhcdbd which calls dhclient
[02:30] <StevenK> No, it uses the dbus dhcp client.
[02:30] <StevenK> Ah. It does, just indirectly.
=== StevenK updates his internal mapping.
[02:31] <pitti> Lathiat: so first it calls dhclient, if that times out, dhclient calls avahi-autoipd through the dhclient-exit-hooks.d script
[02:31] <pitti> Lathiat: during that process, the interface might go up twice (but shouldn't)
[02:31] <pitti> Lathiat: which version of n-m do you have?
[02:31] <Lathiat> Version: 0.6.3-2ubuntu7
[02:31] <pitti> ok, that should just use avahi-autoipd
[02:33] <giskard> pitti, uh! i will grab this patch
[02:33] <Lathiat> so even with using ifconfig, it triggers a series of events that sees the ip added, removed and added again, but network manager seems to remove and add them again
[02:33] <pitti> giskard: which patch?
[02:33] <giskard> avahi-autoipd..
[02:33] <pitti> giskard: if it's the n-m one, I'm about to send it to upstream after it got some initial testing in feisty
[02:34] <giskard> pitti, do you think it's not "stable" enough?
[02:34] <pitti> giskard: I discussed the approach with Dan a bit, and he seems to agree; however, my patch is pretty hackish because I didn't want to rewrite half of the logic
[02:34] <pitti> giskard: oh, it's not unstable, it's just not a nice patch
[02:34] <giskard> oki
[02:34] <Lathiat> pitti: what happens on yoru laptop, is it after a certain time it stops working?
[02:34] <pitti> giskard: the only operational flaw that I see is that the IP address will be shown as '0' in the properties
[02:35] <pitti> giskard: i. e. it doesn't read it out from the ethX:avahi interface
[02:35] <pitti> Lathiat: it never really starts working until I restart it
[02:35] <Lathiat> pitti: so if you start avahi, then use network manager to get an ip
[02:35] <Lathiat> it doesnt work at all
[02:35] <pitti> Lathiat: right
[02:35] <Lathiat> does it do that on a clean boot?
[02:35] <Lathiat> straight away?
[02:35] <pitti> Lathiat: ok, TBH I didn't try it recently before I fiddled with n-j
[02:35] <pitti> n-m even
=== pitti tries
[02:35] <Lathiat> (not a suspend,e tc)
[02:36] <pitti> Lathiat: is "'avahi-browse -ta' not empty" a sufficient test?
[02:36] <Lathiat> pitti: ok, your right, i can reproduce that
[02:36] <Lathiat> start avahi, then use network manager, cant do anything
[02:36] <Lathiat> i will debug from here
[02:37] <pitti> great
[02:37] <pitti> I cross-check on my box
=== pitti wonders how hal verifies netlink packets
[02:37] <Lathiat> and it works if i revert that patch
[02:38] <Lathiat> i only tested the case of starting avahi with a network already up when i did that patch
[02:38] <Lathiat> guess i should have done more :/
[02:38] <pitti> yay, laptop doesn't boot
[02:38] <Lathiat> and it works using ifconfig
[02:38] <Lathiat> but not network manager
[02:38] <Lathiat> i've had this problem befor
[02:39] <Lathiat> enetwork manager was triggering a different code patch
[02:39] <Lathiat> *path
[02:39] <Lathiat> and it works fine with dhclient, just not network manager
[02:39] <Lathiat> it seems that extra withdraw and add does something magic
[02:40] <Lathiat> yep, avahi hasnt joined the multicast group
[02:40] <Lathiat> obviously when it withdraws the interface it drops the membership
[02:40] <Lathiat> and when it comes back, we're dropping that message because it comes from pid != 0
[02:40] <Lathiat> so i'll have to chase that up
[02:40] <Lathiat> thanks for your help
[02:40] <Lathiat> know anyone that knows network manager enough to have an explanation of why it seems to cause that?
[02:42] <doko> dholbach: yes, plus some/one wiki page(s)
[02:42] <dholbach> doko: alright, I needed it to review a java package - if you could give me a link to those wiki pages, that'd be great - for telepathy-wilde and friends too
=== GmanAFK is now known as Gman

[02:43] <sivang> (e.g. managing packages that are affected by the new policy, new spec from UDS as well)
[02:44] <pitti> Lathiat: hal enables sender credentials and refuses uid != 0
[02:44] <pitti> Lathiat: we probably need the avahi-daemon uid, too, but would something like that work?

[04:19] <dholbach> doko: gracias
[04:19] <sivang> can anyone suggest a good package that used debhelper tp update po files? it appears that irda-utils doesn't even include a manual target in debian/rules for updating the translations, I'd like to fix that by adding it. Can someone suggest how?

=== frafu [n=frafu@vodsl-9762.vo.lu]  has left #ubuntu-devel [] 
[04:22] <cjwatson> sivang: you mean stuff in debian/po/
[04:22] <cjwatson> ?
[04:22] <sivang> cjwatson: exactly
[04:23] <cjwatson> sivang: just running debconf-updatepo is usual; I've never seen anyone bother with a debian/rules target for that
[04:23] <cjwatson> since it's easier to type the command and then it's the same for all packages that have translated debconf templates :)
[04:24] <sivang> cjwatson: will this also handle updates to the .pot file?
[04:24] <cjwatson> yes
[04:24] <cjwatson> see its man page with the command-line options
[04:24] <sivang> cjwatson: cool , thanks. Somehow I got the wrong impression this needs to happen when building
[04:24] <sivang> ;)
[04:24] <cjwatson> it's more usual to run it before building the source package, so that they're up to date in the source
[04:25] <sivang> cjwatson: right, makes more sense actually, I had based this impression on the gdebi package upon which I based my hubackup package.
[04:26] <sivang> cjwatson: mvo included there a call to update pot/po files in the form of a call to intltool
[04:28] <sivang> cjwatson: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35783/ , but this is in setup.py
[04:28] <cjwatson> sivang: that tends to happen for .pot/.po files outside debian/po/, since the process for updating those is less consistent

[05:46] <cr3> jdong: what BenC said, and it's not as trivial as I had originally thought :)
[05:47] <mvo> Riddell: no, just unchecked. the goal is to allow people to have a english environment but still use scim

[06:00] <alex-weej> does anyone else think that feisty using compiz/beryl instead of metacity is a bad idea simply because it's just not GNOME anymore?
[06:02] <jdong> alex-weej: but it's shiny. Shiny always better. shiny shiny shiny
[06:02] <Keybuk> alex-weej: GNOME appears to be considering compiz
[06:02] <alex-weej> Keybuk: interesting
[06:02] <alex-weej> Keybuk: well if they consider Metacity to be a POS then i suppose why not
[06:05] <Keybuk> I suspect it's more that they consider metacity to not be a compositing window manager
[06:06] <Solarion> is splice() in the current glibc, or will it be in feisty?
=== mgalvin [n=mgalvin@ubuntu/member/mgalvin]  has joined #ubuntu-devel
[06:07] <Keybuk> Solarion: it's in feisty's libc
[06:08] <Keybuk> the edgy kernel supports it, so you can declare it on your own
[06:09] <Keybuk> syscall (SYS_splice, ...)
[06:09] <Solarion> Keybuk: Ah.  I had wondered.
[06:10] <Solarion> I'll help field-test feisty when it's time

[06:23] <alex-weej> what package is dbus-viewer in these days?
[06:23] <alex-weej> jdong: reproducable
[06:24] <jdong> is it a bug?
[06:24] <alex-weej> i guess it's because windows try to raise themselves as soon as they are clicked
[06:24] <alex-weej> but by the time that happens
[06:24] <alex-weej> you've already activated another window
[06:24] <jdong> yeah, that's what I thought too
[06:24] <alex-weej> and the WM won't let it take focus 
[06:24] <jdong> and it doesn't sound like there's an easy fix
[06:24] <alex-weej> no
[06:24] <alex-weej> other than changing the behaviour of scrollwheel on the window list
[06:25] <alex-weej> to be totally honest with you i don't think it's a good feature
[06:25] <alex-weej> i love being able to scroll through tabs and the workspace switcher
[06:25] <jdong> alex-weej: yeah, i.e. don't allow another window selection until the first one is raised....
[06:25] <alex-weej> but it just seems a bit odd on the wlist
[06:25] <jdong> though that could result in a hang condition
[06:25] <alex-weej> jdong: yeah it could block but that would make it slow
[06:25] <alex-weej> jdong: the most seamless fix would be to make the windows raise, but not steal focus
[06:26] <alex-weej> jdong: but that would require to hint the WM as to what is going on
[06:26] <alex-weej> jdong: as windows don't normally raise if they won't have focus
[06:26] <alex-weej> then again, i know toss all about WMs, so i might be barking up the wrong tree
[06:29] <alex-weej> piss. i've forgotten how to use dbus.

[06:40] <sivang> mjg59: right, sorry, Keybuk already referenced me to the changelog entry.  I was just being blind
[06:44] <bronson> I've built linux-vserver-enabled Dapper and Edgy kernels by following https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelCustomBuild

[06:50] <zorglu_> q. is there a channel for people coding on ubuntu ?
[06:51] <jelmer> I think that's what this channel is intended to be :-)
[06:51] <cjwatson> no, it's not
[06:51] <zorglu_> well :) here all my questions are plain ignored :)
[06:52] <cjwatson> this channel is for the development *of* Ubuntu
[06:52] <zorglu_> cjwatson: and is there a channel for people coding on ubuntu ?
[06:52] <cjwatson> not to my knowledge, but your question is not Ubuntu-specific anyway
[06:52] <bronson> zorglu_: it's a pretty obscure question.  Not many here would have ever done that before.
[06:53] <bronson> At least, I haven't.  :)
[06:53] <bronson> anyway, don't feel bad.  My Ubuntu-related kernel question is being ignored too...
[06:54] <twb> zorglu_: your question would be better addressed to a GCC or glibc forum.  (That's forum as in "a place of discussion",  not forum as in "web forum".)
=== Amaranth [n=travis@ubuntu/member/amaranth]  has joined #ubuntu-devel
[06:55] <twb> zorglu_: plenty of people in here don't even write C programs.  This channel is for people packaging software for Ubuntu, and people building tools to facilitate that.
[06:55] <zorglu_> for info, the question is ubuntu related as it is directly in relation on how glibc is packaged. but cjwatson answered me privatly
[06:56] <twb> Oh, I see.
[06:56] <twb> Excuse my ignorance, then :-)
[06:56] <zorglu_> and the answer is that it is not possible to link in static under ubuntu except if you compile your own glibc :)
[06:56] <mjg59> zorglu_: The question is Ubuntu-related, but still not on-topic for this channel
[06:57] <bronson> Does anyone know why the kernel version appears twice in my AUTOBUILD=1 kernel debs?
[06:57] <kylem> bronson, why don't you try asking on #ubuntu-kernel?
[06:57] <zorglu_> i understood that, just fixing the misconception about how related it was to ubuntu
[06:57] <bronson> kylem: good call; I didn't even realize that existed.  ;)
[06:57] <kylem> bronson, it appears once because it's in the package name, and once because of the version number of the package.
[06:58] <kylem> linux-headers-2.6.17-10-ref-386 is the name, 2.6.17.1-10.34 is the version
[06:58] <kylem> anyway, brb. lunch.
[06:58] <bronson> kylem: thanks
=== bronson investigates
[06:59] <Riddell> cjwatson: it's something funky to do with having two QButtonGroups for one frame
[06:59] <zorglu_> as a suggestion, if somebody asks a question offtopic, i think it is nicer to say 'this is offtopic dont ask this here' that plainly ignore him :)
[06:59] <cjwatson> oh, whee

[07:08] <hunger> Is NM currently broken? It hangs trying to get a IP here... dhclient eth0 works fine though.
[07:10] <mvo> Riddell: it reads the apt cache and checks for the available packages
[07:11] <Riddell> mvo: it seems to take longer than the qt version, which has no progress bar but presumably does the same thing
[07:12] <mvo> Riddell: right. I can check that, it possible that this is the actual checking code that was not ported yet to the common/ code. or its something stupid/wrong happening in the gtk frontend

[10:25] <keescook> bluefoxicy: it's just something I wanted to watch, so I marked it a security vuln.  But you're right, I should just subscribe instead.
[10:26] <bluefoxicy> mjg59:  yes, interesting.  That bug is marked as a security vulnerability now (for some reason); I was wondering 1) why; and 2) doesn't that hide the bug from normal users?
[10:26] <bluefoxicy> keescook:  nods.  Not that I'm complaining about the added attention mind you; just I tried that angle before and was told that it was just wishlist-priority (for gaim) (which I fixed)
[10:26] <keescook> bluefoxicy: there's a difference between "security" and "private"
[10:27] <bluefoxicy> keescook:  ah.  On most (mozilla at least, and gentoo IIRC) bugzillas security == zomg nondisclosure
[10:28] <keescook> I was scratching my head for a while when I first read it because there isn't any amd64 asm, so gpg on my machine doesn't have an exec stack.  :P  showed up (obviously) in the i386 chroot
[10:28] <bluefoxicy> keescook:  by any chance were you interested in looking for these yourself?  :)
=== haggai [n=halls@credativ.bcnadsl.com]  has joined #ubuntu-devel
[10:28] <keescook> yeah, it's on my list of general cleanups, hardening, etc.
[10:29] <bluefoxicy> nods.  Install pax-utils, scanelf -qeR /bin (or /lib or /usr or any combination), and there you go.  There's some good docs .. actually you can just follow the link that's on that bug ;)
[10:30] <keescook> bluefoxicy: if you've been collecting these, can you make a wiki page (if there isn't one already) of the program that need the exec-stack fixes?
[10:30] <keescook> yeah, the gentoo hardening docs are great.
[10:30] <bluefoxicy> keescook:  it's easy enough to generate your own; but sure.  I should move HardenedHacking somewhere easier... and clean it up.
[10:30] <jdong> bluefoxicy: my grsec+PaX is still acting like while true; do echo Segmentation Fault; done
[10:30] <keescook> also on my list is to recompile all of main with PIE and see if I still have a functional system.  :)
[10:31] <jdong> it took them 400 lines of code to accomplish what one bash line could :)
[10:31] <jdong> </sarcasm>
[10:31] <bluefoxicy> keescook:  Gentoo is great in general.  Walk their Portage CVS tree, and you'll find tons of patches to kill executable stacks or PIC violations and such.  It probably wouldn't hurt to get in touch with their hardened herd... (bhale/tseng is a former dev)
[10:32] <LarstiQ> jdong: if all it does is echo.. :)O

[11:32] <Mithrandir> Lure: thanks for your patch; I'll take a look at it tomorrow.
[11:33] <Lure> Mithrandir: thank you 
[11:34] <geser> Mithrandir: could you please give-back gaim-libnotify?

[11:36] <Mithrandir> geser: done
[11:36] <geser> thanks
[11:37] <Mithrandir> and with that, I'm off to bed.
[11:37] <_ion> Gaim has libnotify support? That's great.

[11:39] <psusi> right now filesystems are auto mounted by gnome-volume-manager calling pmount when it gets wind of a new disk from hald which finds out about it from udev right?
[11:41] <psusi> is the goal for fiesty to move to udev doing the mount?  or only to take care of the md/lvm/dmraid parts and leave g-v-m to mount the fs?

=== licio [n=licio@ubuntu/member/licio]  has joined #ubuntu-devel
[11:44] <shaya> weird Q, is there a good document anywhere that explains how apt does dependency resolving?
[11:45] <shaya> or can someone give me a quick and dirty explanation
[11:45] <shawarma> Where are the ddebs stored? Still in pitti's public_html ?
[11:45] <shawarma> shaya: About the code or the policy?
[11:46] <shaya> not so much policy, but given package X, how does it determine closed set of packages it needs to install
=== tsmithe` is now known as tsmithe
[11:46] <shaya> basically looking for something for a writeup I'm doing (where basically saying we don't need to focus on dependency resolving as its a solved problem)
[11:47] <psusi> it looks at the packages that one depends on and if they aren't already isntalled, installs them?
[11:50] <shaya> true, I'm more looking for a specific term, basically we have a huge package graph
[11:50] <shaya> or directed graph
[11:50] <shaya> where package nodes point to the package nodes they depend on
[11:50] <shaya> when you want to install package A, apt-get has to create a "term I don't know"
[11:52] <psusi> it doesn't have to create anything
[11:52] <psusi> it just installs the packages listed in the depends header
[11:52] <psusi> and in doing so, may end up  installing more packages listed in THOSE depends
[11:53] <shawarma> shaya: You're maybe thinking of the dependency tree?
[11:53] <shawarma> shaya: And it seems that you're actually curious about the policy that governs what apt is supposed to do rather than the actual code in apt. :-)
[11:54] <shawarma> shaya: ...and the policy is the debian policy.
[11:54] <shawarma> shaya: You're still free to ask, of course.

[12:04] <shaya> the term I'm looking for is transitive closure
[12:04] <shaya> basically there's a dependency graph, and apt-get searches for the transitive closure
[12:05] <geser> barrett9h: install libc6-dev-i386
