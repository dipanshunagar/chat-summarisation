6/30/16, 10:30 PM - Deepika Sharma: Deepika this side
6/30/16, 10:30 PM - Neha Gupta: Hii
6/30/16, 10:30 PM - Deepika Sharma: Hi
6/30/16, 10:31 PM - Deepika Sharma: So mainly I wanted to know how good the job prospects are after passing out of HEC
6/30/16, 10:31 PM - Neha Gupta: Hey! Honestly depends on what you want to do
6/30/16, 10:32 PM - Deepika Sharma: Could you explain a bit?
6/30/16, 10:32 PM - Neha Gupta: And how flexible you are with that choice
6/30/16, 10:33 PM - Neha Gupta: There are jobs in finance, there are jobs in industry and there are fewer (because of language barriers) in consulting
6/30/16, 10:33 PM - Neha Gupta: You have access to the european and middle eastern market for employment
6/30/16, 10:34 PM - Deepika Sharma: So for jobs in finance there's no language barrier?
6/30/16, 10:34 PM - Neha Gupta: MiM is good, because it is three years with one year gap so you get plenty of time to establish base in the country
6/30/16, 10:34 PM - Neha Gupta: I would personally not recommend one year courses unless it is a brilliant institution like MIT because it is very tough to first settle, understand the economy and recruitment process and then convert your knowledge into a job
6/30/16, 10:35 PM - Neha Gupta: Not as much. Though I would say if you intend to come to HEC, start learning Frenc
6/30/16, 10:35 PM - Neha Gupta: The commitment will only add to your profile regardless of your final decision
6/30/16, 10:35 PM - Neha Gupta: It is beneficial, no matter what. In daily life as well.
6/30/16, 10:36 PM - Neha Gupta: I mean I'm searching for a house right now and all my contracts and banking transactions and insurance are in french. so you get the importance if you plan to move
6/30/16, 10:36 PM - Neha Gupta: It will be more difficult if you don't know french
6/30/16, 10:36 PM - Neha Gupta: However, most of the indians working here do not know french very well
6/30/16, 10:39 PM - Deepika Sharma: Oh alright
6/30/16, 10:39 PM - Deepika Sharma: Does HEC have a 3 year program? The one that you're doing
6/30/16, 10:41 PM - Deepika Sharma: I'm sorry
6/30/16, 10:41 PM - Deepika Sharma: Sometimes i get poor internet connection
6/30/16, 10:41 PM - Neha Gupta: The one I am doing is a two year program with a gap year for internships
6/30/16, 10:42 PM - Neha Gupta: which effectively makes it three years
6/30/16, 10:42 PM - Neha Gupta: I am currently on my gap year so will be interning in Paris
6/30/16, 10:42 PM - Deepika Sharma: Oh alright. This is the grand ecole program?
6/30/16, 10:42 PM - Neha Gupta: I have Indian friends interning in France, Germany, Denmark, UK
6/30/16, 10:42 PM - Neha Gupta: Yes
6/30/16, 10:42 PM - Deepika Sharma: Okay
6/30/16, 10:43 PM - Neha Gupta: Oh and the pay is pretty decent here :P
6/30/16, 10:43 PM - Neha Gupta: Even for interns
6/30/16, 10:43 PM - Deepika Sharma: Oh. Nice
6/30/16, 10:43 PM - Deepika Sharma: But so must be the expenses no?
6/30/16, 10:43 PM - Neha Gupta: Yes, it is expensive
6/30/16, 10:44 PM - Neha Gupta: Not as much as USA at all
6/30/16, 10:44 PM - Neha Gupta: But for Europe it is quite expensive
6/30/16, 10:44 PM - Neha Gupta: But one of the most reputed as well, and cheaper than UK
6/30/16, 10:44 PM - Neha Gupta: You really want to look at the ROI and how much the course helps you get where you want.
6/30/16, 10:45 PM - Deepika Sharma: So did you not want to go to US?
6/30/16, 10:45 PM - Neha Gupta: What are you thinking of doing?
6/30/16, 10:45 PM - Neha Gupta: Do you have any idea of where you want to be? What kind of universities are you looking at?
6/30/16, 10:46 PM - Neha Gupta: I did not honestly
6/30/16, 10:46 PM - Neha Gupta: I didn't even apply, I personally did not wish to spend so much
6/30/16, 10:47 PM - Neha Gupta: and USA does not interest as much as it does some people
6/30/16, 10:47 PM - Deepika Sharma: What kind of jobs are you looking at?
6/30/16, 10:48 PM - Neha Gupta: My first internship is in corporate marketing strategy and second in investment banking
6/30/16, 10:49 PM - Deepika Sharma: Oh so you intern at more than one place?
6/30/16, 10:49 PM - Deepika Sharma: For how long do you intern
6/30/16, 10:48 PM - Neha Gupta: I am inclined towards consulting or  in-house strategy
6/30/16, 10:51 PM - Neha Gupta: Yes 6 months each
6/30/16, 10:51 PM - Neha Gupta: Then I have the summer to do one more if I want
6/30/16, 10:51 PM - Neha Gupta: It is usually 4-6 months
6/30/16, 10:51 PM - Neha Gupta: Mostly six and summers are separate
6/30/16, 10:51 PM - Deepika Sharma: Oh alright
6/30/16, 10:51 PM - Deepika Sharma: That's actually nice
6/30/16, 10:52 PM - Deepika Sharma: Do companies come for placements and internships there?
6/30/16, 10:52 PM - Neha Gupta: It is to figure out what you like
6/30/16, 10:52 PM - Neha Gupta: Placements are not like in India
6/30/16, 10:52 PM - Deepika Sharma: How does it happen then?
6/30/16, 10:52 PM - Neha Gupta: Nowhere outside India do companies come on campus
6/30/16, 10:53 PM - Deepika Sharma: Oh alright
6/30/16, 11:03 PM - Deepika Sharma: Couldn't connect
6/30/16, 11:02 PM - Neha Gupta: I'm going underground now
6/30/16, 11:02 PM - Neha Gupta: So text
6/30/16, 11:03 PM - Deepika Sharma: Oh alright
6/30/16, 11:03 PM - Deepika Sharma: So what all colleges did you apply to?
6/30/16, 11:04 PM - Deepika Sharma: And would you suggest that it's better to do MBA (like after work ex of 3-4 years) or is MIM a better choice?
6/30/16, 11:06 PM - Neha Gupta: I applied to SSE , EDHEC and HEC for early admissions
6/30/16, 11:06 PM - Neha Gupta: So didn't apply anywhere after HEC
6/30/16, 11:06 PM - Neha Gupta: depends on what you want
6/30/16, 11:06 PM - Neha Gupta: I was sure I wanted to move out immediately
6/30/16, 11:07 PM - Deepika Sharma: Actually the thing is I'm not sure of what I want to do
6/30/16, 11:07 PM - Deepika Sharma: Like which field i want to get into
6/30/16, 11:07 PM - Neha Gupta: Well you need to start thinking and figuring it out
6/30/16, 11:08 PM - Neha Gupta: If not be specific but the general direction
6/30/16, 11:08 PM - Deepika Sharma: I just know that I want to start up something of my own
6/30/16, 11:09 PM - Neha Gupta: I'm sorry but I don't know about entrepreneur ship as a career choice
6/30/16, 11:09 PM - Neha Gupta: So my advise won't be helpful in that field honestly
6/30/16, 11:10 PM - Deepika Sharma: Okay. I understand
6/30/16, 11:10 PM - Neha Gupta: But then how does leaving India for a job make sense though?
6/30/16, 11:11 PM - Deepika Sharma: That's what. That's why I'm confused. And I thought that I would just get some work ex first. Then work on starting up. 

So I thought that I should just get a GMAT score and then see how it goes
6/30/16, 11:11 PM - Deepika Sharma: Also, ISB is what I wanted to apply for too
6/30/16, 11:11 PM - Deepika Sharma: That's why GMAT
6/30/16, 11:12 PM - Neha Gupta: Okay, it is good to have back ups
6/30/16, 11:13 PM - Deepika Sharma: What are the things required for admission into HEC?
6/30/16, 11:13 PM - Deepika Sharma: What do they look for
6/30/16, 11:14 PM - Deepika Sharma: And what was your score?
6/30/16, 11:13 PM - Neha Gupta: Focus on your gmat, maybe try a school known for entrepreneurship
6/30/16, 11:14 PM - Neha Gupta: I wouldn't recommend hec because their entrepreneur center focuses on French market and will be tough to crack into because of language barriers
6/30/16, 11:14 PM - Neha Gupta: My score was 730
6/30/16, 11:15 PM - Neha Gupta: I am not sure what they look at but they like some decent internships, and good eca I guess
6/30/16, 11:15 PM - Neha Gupta: And French can be beneficial
6/30/16, 11:16 PM - Deepika Sharma: Alright.
6/30/16, 11:17 PM - Deepika Sharma: So would you suggest that i shouldn't go into any program for now, till the time I'm sure of what I want from it?
6/30/16, 11:17 PM - Neha Gupta: Perhaps yes
6/30/16, 11:18 PM - Neha Gupta: In the meanwhile try to get a good brand name on your CV and a good profile
6/30/16, 11:18 PM - Neha Gupta: You can do a Masters anytime
6/30/16, 11:18 PM - Neha Gupta: Most people at hec are older than me
6/30/16, 11:18 PM - Deepika Sharma: Oh alright
6/30/16, 11:19 PM - Deepika Sharma: What is the average age?
6/30/16, 11:19 PM - Neha Gupta: But honestly I have told you all I know
6/30/16, 11:19 PM - Neha Gupta: At the end of the day what you want to do
6/30/16, 11:19 PM - Neha Gupta: And what you like
6/30/16, 11:19 PM - Neha Gupta: The average age is 23-24
